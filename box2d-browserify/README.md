# Box2dweb and Browserify

Browserify has one major drawback. It is compilation step after each change to the code. The compilation can be automatized by e.g. Grunt - like I have done in this repo.

I believe that in the ultimate environment change in code would be visible on browser straight away - altering runtime on the fly.
